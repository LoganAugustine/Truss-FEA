# Truss FEA Program for AERO 306 - Structural Analysis II (Python)

This program will calculate the deflection of a truss structure with a given orientation and applied force. The user will create a detailed input file with nodal coordinates, information on the elements of the truss, and the forces involved. With this file the program will calculate the deflection of each node on the truss, output a visual plot of the original truss, and then a plot of the deformation of the truss after the load is applied. 

This program was created for my final project for AERO 306 - Structural Analysis II at Texas A&M University. It can be used to perform Finite Element Analysis for any truss, so long as it is correctly defined in the input file, which I will provide detailed instructions for. 

This repository consists of the main code, the plotting code, 3 input files, and 3 problems and their results. 


***The plotting code was generously provided by Professor Hartl and graciously supplied by our classmate, Miracle. His code for plotting the trusses and their deformation was invaluable for me as a visual learner. It is 100% accredited to him and his hard work.
